# Customer-churn analysis

# Overview
This project focuses on identifying the key factors that contribute to customer churn in a telecom company. Using a dataset containing customer information and service usage patterns, we employ data analysis techniques to predict which customers are likely to leave (churn) and provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

# Objective
The primary goals of this project are to:

Analyze customer demographics, service usage, and contract details.

Identify patterns and behaviors associated with churn.

Predict the likelihood of churn using machine learning models.

Provide recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Define proper KPIs

Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs

Write a short email and explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed
# Tools and Technologies
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Handling: SQL
Reporting: Power BI 
# Dataset
The dataset contains the following key features:

CustomerID
Gender, Age, and Demographics
Services used (e.g., Internet, Phone, Streaming)
Contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
Monthly charges and total charges
Tenure (length of time as a customer)
Churn (whether the customer has churned or not)
Key Analysis & Steps
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Encoded categorical variables and normalized numeric features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized customer demographics, contract types, and service usage patterns.
Analyzed the relationship between tenure, charges, and churn.
# Feature Engineering:

Created new features (e.g., tenure groups) to improve model performance.
# Churn Prediction:

Built multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Insights and Recommendations:

Identified customer segments with higher churn rates (e.g., customers with month-to-month contracts).
Recommended strategies to retain customers based on predictive insights.
Project Structure

README.md: Overview of the project.

# Results
Key Churn Drivers: Customers with short tenure and high monthly charges are more likely to churn.
Best Performing Model: Random Forest with an accuracy of [XX%] and F1-score of [XX%].
# Business Recommendations:
Offer incentives or discounts for customers on month-to-month contracts.
Improve customer support for high-usage service customers.
# Future Work
Explore deeper customer segmentation using clustering.
Apply advanced techniques such as deep learning for improved churn prediction.
Create real-time churn prediction models for integration with customer management systems.
# Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer churn, helping the telecom company identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to reduce churn and improve retention rates.
